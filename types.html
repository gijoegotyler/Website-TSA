      <h1>Types of Cloud Computing</h1>
      <h2>Saas</h2>
      <p class="text">Saas is the abbreviation for Software as a Service. It provides your applications over the internet, through your browser. Major examples of Saas are Google's G Suite and Microsoft's Office 365. Saas is one of the most common types of Cloud Computing.</p>
      <h2>Iaas</h2>
      <p class="text">Iaas is the abbreviation for Infrastructure as a Service. On a simple level it can provide storage. Major cloud providers have services like application monitoring, virtual private networks, and data analytics. The most recognizable Iaas platforms are Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. This is the other most common use of Cloud computing.</p>
      <h2>Paas</h2>
      <p class="text">Paas is the abbreviation for Platform as a Service. It is mainly used by developers of websites and applications. It makes the development of the application or website go much faster. There two major providers, Heroku and Force. This cloud service is not used by most people. It was designed mainly for developers, who wanted to speed up the development of their application or website.</p>
      <h2>Faas</h2>
      <p class="text">Faas is the abbreviation for functions as a Service. They are cloud services that run on the back end of web pages and applications. They are only triggered when necessary to keep costs down. Major providers are Amazon Web Services Lambda and Google Cloud Functions. Like Paas this cloud service is designed for developers. It serves almost no purpose to the general public.</p>
      <h2>Public</h2>
      <p class="text">Public Cloud is great for smaller businesses because it allows the company or person using it not need any or much IT at all. It also is useful because you pay for what you use. Although it is slightly unreliable because someone else is hosting your server which is risky for very important information. One other problem with public cloud computing is that it relies on high speed internet because you can't wire your computers up to servers because the servers aren't in your building.</p>
      <h2>Private</h2>
      <p class="text">Private cloud is also known as internal cloud or corporate cloud. It is a cloud server ran by company and only used by the company. The company or enterprise must set-up the cloud server. This is more reliable and reduces the risk of having some one else host your cloud server. Also, the capabilities are more because you can do anything you want with out restrictions from a cloud service provider. The problems with private cloud computing are that it usually requires a IT program to be deployed and matained.</p>
      <h2>Hybrid</h2>
      <p class="text">This tends to be the most attractive for major and minor companies. It relies on some private and public cloud computing. It uses the private cloud server for very important information that can't be risked of being unusable for any amount of time. The setup can get quite complicated if the company chooses to use several public cloud services for security reasons. They are very good for varying loads of work because you have a medium sized server as private, so when you need larger loads you can use public, so you don't have to pay for a large server all the time. It also is very effective at security because it splits information across many cloud servers.</p>
